# API_testing_RestfulBooker
# performance-test-with-python-locust-user-managed-csv-file
This project is done to do performance testing with couple of api in locust and user is provided with csv file using python as a language.

### Prerequisites and set-up:
To run a Locust performance testing project, you’ll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

Step-1: To run Locust, navigate to the project directory and execute locust command as shown in below section


Step-2: Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8089 to access the Locust web interface, where you can start and control the test.

    1. terminal/cmd/bash -> locust -r 10 -u 3 --host=base_url
    2. go to browsers url -> http://localhost:8089/ -> start/advance options to add test duration 
    3. Click start.
    4. Explore the UI to see the results and charts as shown below.

### locust command Explanation:
For Example:

`locust -r 10 -u 100 --host=base_url`

 Details:

`-r: The hatch rate, which is the number of users hatching per second.` 

In this example, it's set to 10.

`-u: The total number of users to simulate during the test. In this example, it's set to 100`

### Tasks
Create a list of user in the application and add those users info in the `resouces>users`
csv file in the below format.

username,password

admin,password123

easabbir,Abbl_234

easabbir,Abbl_234

**Users list can be reused, if provided in the csv file. 

**In the run command, make sure not to give `-u` value, more than the users count of the csv file.
